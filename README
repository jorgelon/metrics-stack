# Metrics stack

This is a non production and opinionated deployment of a prometheus instance with kubernetes and other applications metrics
It is meant to be deployed under the "monitoring" namespace and a kubeadm kubernetes cluster

## For this I am using

- Kustomize
- Prometheus Operator (official manifests)
- Grafana Operator (official manifests)
- Prometheus Adapter (official manifests)
- Kube State Metrics (hand made manifests)
- Node exporter (hand made manifests)
- Some argocd related settings, like waves
- Stakater reloader annotations in grafana
